Thanos was one of the last sons of A'Lars, progenitor of the second
colony of Eternals on Titan, and Sui-San, the last survivor of the
original settlement of Eternals in this moon. He was born with purple,
hide-like skin and a massive body due to his Deviant Syndrome. The very
first time his mother laid her eyes on the baby, she was driven mad and
tried to kill him.
